This originally ran on Heroku.  It was a bot for my private servers that renamed images using a timestamp, so that they would have a unique name.  (It frustrated me to have to manually rename images that I wanted to save.)
Eventually, I added the ability to search for Magic the Gathering cards using a public API.
When Heroku stopped their free tiers, I pulled it down.  I think it actually stopped running some time before that.
